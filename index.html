      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</strong> : (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; 17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), shortened as Sheikh Mujib or just Mujib, was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is often called the father of Bengali nation. He served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh from 17 April 1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975.
        </li>
      <li> <strong>Early political career</strong> : After the Partition of India, Mujib chose to stay in the newly created Pakistan. On his return to what became known as East Pakistan, he enrolled in the University of Dhaka to study law and founded the East Pakistan Muslim Students' League.
          </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bengali language movement</strong> : Following the declaration of Muhammad Ali Jinnah on 21 March 1948, that the people of East Bengal would have to adopt Urdu as the state language, protests broke out amongst the population.[15] Mujib immediately decided to start a movement against this former planned decision of the Muslim League. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Six point movement</strong> : Following Suhrawardy's death in 1963, Mujib came to head the Awami League, which became one of the largest political parties in Pakistan.Unrest over continuing denial of democracy spread across Pakistan and Mujib intensified his opposition to the disbandment of provinces. In 1966, Mujib proclaimed a 6-point plan titled Our Charter of Survival at a national
          conference of opposition political parties at Lahore,[5] in which he demanded self-government and considerable
          political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani federation with a weak central government.
          According to his plan:
          <ol id="six-points">
            <li>The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the Lahore Resolution and the
            parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected on the basis of the universal adult
            franchise.</li>
            <li>The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defense and foreign affairs, and all other residuary subjects
            shall be vested in the federating states.</li>
            <li>Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there
            should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the
            flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate banking reserve should be established and separate
            fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.</li>
            <li>The power of taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal center will have no
            such power. The Federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.</li>
            <li>There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange
            requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous
            products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish
            trade links with foreign countries.</li>
            <li>East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anti-Ayub movement</strong> :Mujib was arrested by the Pakistan Army and after two years in jail, an official sedition trial in a military court opened. Widely known as the Agartala Conspiracy Case, Mujib and 34 Bengali military officers were accused by the government of colluding with Indian government agents in a scheme to divide Pakistan and threaten its unity, order and national security. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Establishment of Bangladesh</strong> : Following political deadlock, Yahya Khan delayed the convening of the assembly – a move seen by Bengalis as a plan to deny Mujib's party, which formed a majority, from taking charge. It was on 7 March 1971 that Mujib called for independence and asked the people to launch a major campaign of civil disobedience and organized armed resistance at a mass gathering of people held at the Race Course Ground in Dhaka. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struggle for national reconstruction</strong> : In the aftermath of the Pakistani army's rampage last March, a special team of inspectors from the World Bank observed that some cities looked "like the morning after a nuclear attack." Since then, the destruction has only been magnified. An estimated 6,000,000 homes have been destroyed, and nearly 1,400,000 farm families have been left without tools or animals to work their lands. Transportation and communications systems are totally disrupted. Roads are damaged, bridges out and inland waterways blocked. The rape of the country continued right up until the Pakistani army surrendered a month ago.
        </li>
        <blockquote>
          <P>"The struggle now is the struggle for our emancipation; the struggle now is the struggle for our independence. Joy Bangla!..Since we have given blood, we will give more blood. God-willing, the people of this country will be liberated ... Turn every house into a fort. Face (the enemy) with whatever you have."</P>
